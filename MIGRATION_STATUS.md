## Next Priority Functions ðŸŽ¯

These are recommended based on simplicity and usefulness:

| Function | Description | Why Priority |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| ENORM | Euclidean norm | Simple, widely used |
| DENORM | Double precision norm | Pair with ENORM |
| FDUMP | Error message dump | Part of error system |
| J4SAVE | Save/recall error state | Foundation function |
| LSAME | Compare characters (BLAS) | Simple utility |
| ZABS | Complex absolute value | Simple complex arithmetic |
| ISAMAX | Index of max abs value | BLAS utility |
| SASUM | Sum of absolute values | BLAS utility |

## Available Functions ðŸ“‹

The complete list of 167 available zero-dependency functions is in `zero_dependency_functions.json`. 

Key categories of available functions:
- **BLAS-like operations**: SCOPY, SSCAL, SDOT, SAXPY, etc.
- **Complex arithmetic**: ZABS, ZEXP, ZMLT, ZSHCH
- **Utilities**: Various helper functions
- **Special cases**: AAAAAA (documentation), FDUMP (error handling)

## How to Claim a Function

1. Check this file to ensure the function isn't already claimed
2. Add your function to the "In Progress" section with your name and start date
3. Commit this change immediately to avoid conflicts
4. When complete, move to "Completed" section with test count and date

## Migration Requirements

Before marking a function as complete:
- [ ] Minimum 100 test cases (more for complex functions)
- [ ] 100% test pass rate
- [ ] Test data saved in `test_data/funcname_tests.json`
- [ ] Modern implementation in `modern/funcname_modern.f90`
- [ ] No compiler warnings
- [ ] Algorithm preserved from original

## Notes

- ENORM has a modern/utilities/enorm_module.f90 from old approach but no test data - needs proper migration
- DENORM also exists but marked as migrated in old approach - needs verification
- Some functions like AAAAAA are just documentation and don't need migration
- Functions ending in 1/2/3/4 are often variants that might share implementation
